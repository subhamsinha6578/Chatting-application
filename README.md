Here, we will use two classes Socket and ServerSocket. The Socket class is used to communicate between the client and the server

Socket programming is used to work with sockets which helps in making a network connection to the server. It works as a client-server method where the client sends the request to the server and the server responds to the client with the requested data.

Where the messages are getting exchanged in real-time. It can run multiple client-server chats easily.
